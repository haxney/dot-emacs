;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This program displays ``tailed'' contents of files inside
;;  transients windows of Emacs.  It is primarily meant to keep an eye
;;  on logs within Emacs instead of using additional terminals.
;;
;;  This was developed for GNU Emacs 20.x but should work as well for
;;  XEmacs 21.x
;;
;;  Primary URL for tail.el is http://inferno.cs.univ-paris8.fr/~drieu/emacs/
