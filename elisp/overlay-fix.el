;;; Commentary:
;;
;; In GNU Emacs versions before 21 when the overlay 'face property is
;; nil it can disable the overlayed text face property.  The most
;; visible issue is that overlayed text is not syntax highlighted.
;; This library advices the built-in functions `make-overlay',
;; `overlay-put' and `overlay-get' to ensure that the overlay 'face
;; property will never be nil but `overlay-fix-empty-face' instead.
;; And that callers will continue to see nil for the corresponding
;; 'face property.

;;; History:
;;

;;; Code:
(if (or (featurep 'xemacs) (> emacs-major-version 20))
    ;; Not needed for Emacs since v21 nor XEmacs
    nil

  ;; Define an empty face
  (make-empty-face 'overlay-fix-empty-face)

  (defadvice make-overlay (after after-make-overlay activate)
    "Ensure overlay 'face property is never nil."
    (or (overlay-get ad-return-value 'face)
        (overlay-put ad-return-value 'face 'overlay-fix-empty-face)))

  (defadvice overlay-put (around before-overlay-put activate)
    "Ensure overlay 'face property is never nil."
    (if (and (eq (ad-get-arg 1) 'face)
             (null (ad-get-arg 2)))
        (ad-set-arg 2 'overlay-fix-empty-face))
    ad-do-it
    (and  (eq (ad-get-arg 1) 'face)
          (eq (ad-get-arg 2) 'overlay-fix-empty-face)
          (setq ad-return-value nil)))

  (defadvice overlay-get (after after-overlay-get activate)
    "Ensure overlay 'face property is never nil."
    (if (and (eq (ad-get-arg 1) 'face)
             (eq ad-return-value 'overlay-fix-empty-face))
        (setq ad-return-value nil)))

  )
